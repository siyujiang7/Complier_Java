1. 
	SimpleC cannot initialize a variabe when creating it;
	SimpleC does not have struct;
	SimpleC does not have constant variable;
	SimpleC does not have typedef;
	SimpleC cannot import library;

2. in order to match the exact stage in the grammar, instead of being matched by a ambiguous upper statement;

3.
	a. valid;
	b. valid;
	c. invalid, because once the return_val_opt stage is entered, there is not way to recursively travel to another return_val_opt stage to retrun again;
	d. invalid, because it is not allowed in simpleC to initialize a variable when creating it;
	e. invalid, because the grammar does not allow defining a function inside a function;
	f. invalid, this violate the grammar pattern of FOR loop in simpleC;
